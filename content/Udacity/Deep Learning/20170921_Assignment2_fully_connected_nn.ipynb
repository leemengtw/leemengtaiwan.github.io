    "Because we use a more complex model(1 hidden-layer NN), it take a little longer to train, but we're able to gain more performance from logistic regression even with the same hyper-parameter settings (learning rate = 0.5, batch_size=128). Better performance may be gained by tuning hyper parameters of the 2 layer NN. Also notice that by using mini-batch / SGD, we can save lots of time training models and even get a better result. "

  "Description": "The goal here is to progressively train deeper and more accurate models using TensorFlow. We will first load the notMNIST dataset which we have done data cleaning. For the classification problem, we will first train two logistic regression models use simple gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) respectively for optimization to see the difference between these optimizers.",
